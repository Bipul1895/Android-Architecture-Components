We created a Note.java class and annotated it with Entity so Room creates
an SQLite table for it.

Our Repository class uses NoteDao object to retrieve all the data in the table
as a list wrapped in LiveData.

ViewModel then retrieves the same live data from the Repository class and caches
it for main activity.

Main activity does not store the data itself but observers the LiveData stored
in the ViewModel and automatically receives an updated list of notes whenever
the data changes in the table.
