Created a FAB in activity_main.xml :
    Created 3 vector assets in drawable folder for icons :
        one for fab, one for save option and one for cross button

Created AddNoteActivity

Created a menu directory and added menu resource file : add_note_menu.xml
This menu contains the save button icon

Major work : AddNoteActivity.java
Added 3 fields : title, description and priority
Added Up button using : getSupportActionBar.setHomeAsUpIndicator();

OnCreateOptionsMenu to create menu.

Our viewModel class contains our all database operations including returning
all the list of Note objects. Also a viewModel binds itself to a particular activity.
One thing we can do is : create two different viewModels, one for MainActivity and
one for AddNoteActivity, which is complicated. It is simpler to make AddNoteActivity
return its result to MainActivity.

The way to achieve is by using StartActivityForResult() and onActivity() result in caller
activity (here MainActivity) and setResult() method in the called activity (here AddNoteActivity).

StartActivityForResult takes two args : intent object and request code. This request code
is later used in the onActivityResult() method to recognize which Activity's result we are
retrieving. MainActivity call many activities using StartActivityForResult(), request code
is used to distinguish b/w them. AddNoteActivity calls setResult() method which sends an
intent object (which carries data) along with a "result code" which tells if operation
was successful.

Note that to use startActivityForResult(), go to manifest file and inside MainActivity
and add the tag : launchMode = "SingleTop"
