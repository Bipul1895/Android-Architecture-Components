What is the role of ViewModel?
Store and process data from UI and communicate with the Model
It requests data from the Repository class and sends it
to the Activity so it can draw it on the screen.
Also, it forwards user's actions from UI to the repository.

Why is ViewModel so important?
It is important to put UI related info. in the view model instead of
UI controller (correct term for Activity/Fragment) itself because it
can survive configuration changes and we don't have to use bundle
again and again. The method of using bundle is one of the many "callback"
techniques and is error-prone and good only if we have less number of
fields.

Putting data in ViewModel is excellent idea as view model is removed only
when lifecycle of of the corresponding activity ends (activity is destroyed).
